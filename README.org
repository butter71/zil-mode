zil-mode comes with one default keybinding:

   | Binding | Action                                   |
   |---------+------------------------------------------|
   | ~M-;~   | zil-comment-dwim                         |


** Installation

Manually:

#+begin_src elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/place/where/you/put/it/")
  (require 'zil-mode)
#+end_src

** Notes

- This is v0.0.1 and definitely full of bugs and unexpected behavior.
  It is not necessarily a shining example of emacs-lisp.

- Story text (for example in a TELL function) is indented at column 0
  similar to how it appears in infocom source.  This does not currently
  work if one of the lines starts with an atom.  For example the line
  starting with ",TROLL" should be at column 0, but it will instead be
  indented under "TELL".

#+begin_src zil
  <ROUTINE ...
           <TELL
  "You are in a maze of twisty passages.  All alike."
  ,TROLL " is here.">
#+end_src
